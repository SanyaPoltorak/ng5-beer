    "description": "Often called the best Tripel in the world, Tripel Karmaliet has one endless awards. It’s brewed using barley, wheat and oats which give it a smooth mouthfeel and more complex malt body. On top of that the brewery layers banana-like esters from the yeast and a little hop spiciness that adds a quinine-like dryness to the finish. A stunning example of the style."

    "description": "Chimay Triple, differentiated only by \"Cinq Cents\" on the 750 ml bottle, from the 33cl Triple. A golden colour, this Trappist beer combines sweet and bitter in a rare balance. The beer's aroma felt in the mouth comes from the hops' perfumes: above all, they are fruity touches of Muscat grapes and raisins, even ripe apples. This traditional Belgian beer is best savoured fresh at a temperature 6 to 8¬∞C."

The use of peat smoked malt is modern, but the flavours are pure Irish history. A rich, sweet malt base and delicate hop bite make this as truly unique and superb beer."
